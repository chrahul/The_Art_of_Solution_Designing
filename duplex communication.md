Duplex communication, also known as full-duplex communication, refers to a communication method where both parties involved in the communication can send and receive data simultaneously. In other words, duplex communication allows for two-way communication, where information can flow in both directions concurrently.

There are two main types of duplex communication:

1. **Half-Duplex Communication:** In half-duplex communication, data transmission can occur in both directions, but not simultaneously. Instead, communication alternates between sending and receiving data. While one party is transmitting data, the other party is listening or waiting to receive data. After the transmission is complete, the roles reverse, allowing the other party to transmit while the first party receives.

2. **Full-Duplex Communication:** Full-duplex communication allows both parties to send and receive data simultaneously. This means that both parties can communicate with each other at the same time without any waiting or alternating roles. Each party has its own dedicated channel for sending and receiving data, enabling concurrent communication in both directions.

Full-duplex communication is commonly used in various communication technologies and protocols, including:

- Telephone systems
- Ethernet networks
- Wi-Fi networks
- Bluetooth connections
- Serial communication protocols
- Websockets

In the context of Websockets, full-duplex communication allows for real-time, bi-directional communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. Both the client and server can send and receive messages simultaneously, enabling interactive and responsive web applications with features like live updates, chat, and real-time collaboration.
