### When to Choose API Gateway
- **Use Cases for API Gateway**
  - Aggregating multiple microservices into a single endpoint
  - Managing and securing APIs
  - Rate limiting and throttling
  - API versioning and transformation
- **Real-World Scenarios**
  - Example 1: An e-commerce platform needing to expose various services (catalog, payment, user management) under a unified API
  - Example 2: A SaaS application requiring API management for different client apps with varying access levels

### When to Choose Load Balancer
- **Use Cases for Load Balancer**
  - Distributing traffic across multiple instances of a microservice
  - Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance
  - Session persistence and sticky sessions
- **Real-World Scenarios**
  - Example 1: A social media platform handling massive traffic with multiple instances of each service (user service, post service, comment service)
  - Example 2: A financial application requiring high availability and load distribution for its transaction processing service

### Combined Use of API Gateway and Load Balancer
- **How They Complement Each Other**
  - Fronting an API gateway with a load balancer for enhanced routing and security
  - Using load balancers behind API gateways for distributing traffic to microservice instances
- **Real-World Scenarios**
  - Example 1: A media streaming service using API Gateway for client requests and Load Balancer for distributing traffic to streaming servers
  - Example 2: An online gaming platform employing an API Gateway for player interactions and a Load Balancer for backend game servers

### Best Practices and Recommendations
- **Performance Optimization**
  - Tips for optimizing API gateways
  - Strategies for efficient load balancing
- **Security Enhancements**
