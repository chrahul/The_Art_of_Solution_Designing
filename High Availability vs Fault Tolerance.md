High availability (HA) and fault tolerance are both key concepts in designing resilient and reliable systems, but they address different aspects of system reliability and continuity.

**High Availability (HA):**
High availability refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically measured as a percentage of uptime over a given period. A highly available system is designed to minimize downtime and ensure that services remain accessible even in the event of hardware failures, software failures, or planned maintenance activities.

**Example with AWS:**
In an AWS environment, achieving high availability often involves deploying resources across multiple availability zones (AZs) within a region and using load balancers to distribute traffic among these zones. For instance, you might deploy a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AZs and use an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute incoming requests. If one AZ experiences an outage or instance failure, the ELB automatically redirects traffic to healthy instances in other AZs, ensuring uninterrupted service availability.

**Use Case for High Availability:**
High availability is crucial for mission-critical applications and services where downtime can result in significant financial losses, reputation damage, or legal consequences. Use cases include e-commerce platforms, online banking systems, healthcare applications, and any service that requires continuous availability to meet customer demands.

**Fault Tolerance:**
Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system to continue operating properly in the presence of faults or failures. Unlike high availability, which focuses on minimizing downtime and ensuring accessibility, fault tolerance emphasizes the system's ability to gracefully handle failures without impacting its overall functionality or performance.

**Example with AWS:**
In AWS, achieving fault tolerance often involves implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms at various layers of the architecture. For example, you might replicate data across multiple Availability Zones using Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments or Amazon S3 cross-region replication. Additionally, services like AWS Lambda automatically handle the underlying infrastructure, ensuring that functions remain available even if underlying infrastructure components fail.

**Use Case for Fault Tolerance:**
Fault tolerance is critical for systems where data integrity, consistency, and reliability are paramount, such as financial systems, healthcare records, and emergency response systems. Use cases also include distributed systems, real-time data processing, and applications that require continuous operation in unpredictable environments.

**Choosing Between High Availability and Fault Tolerance:**
- **High Availability:** Choose high availability when uptime and accessibility are top priorities, and downtime must be minimized to ensure continuous service delivery. High availability architectures typically involve redundancy, load balancing, and automated failover mechanisms.
  
- **Fault Tolerance:** Choose fault tolerance when maintaining data integrity, consistency, and resilience in the face of failures is critical. Fault-tolerant architectures focus on redundancy, data replication, and graceful degradation to ensure that the system can continue operating despite failures.

In some cases, both high availability and fault tolerance may be necessary to ensure a robust and resilient system. It's important to assess the specific requirements, risks, and constraints of your application or service to determine the most appropriate architectural approach.
