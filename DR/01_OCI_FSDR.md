# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Full Stack Disaster Recovery (OCI FSDR) 

## **Introduction to OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery (FSDR)**  
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure **Full Stack Disaster Recovery (OCI FSDR)** is an automated disaster recovery **orchestration and management service** designed to protect entire application stacks across OCI regions. Unlike traditional disaster recovery (DR) solutions that focus only on individual components (like databases or compute instances), OCI FSDR ensures the seamless recovery of **applications, middleware, databases, and infrastructure** in the event of a failure.

This tutorial provides a **step-by-step guide** to understanding, setting up, and managing disaster recovery using OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery.

## **1. Key Features of OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery**  
**End-to-End DR Automation** – Automates failover, failback, and validation processes, reducing human errors.  
**Full Application Stack Protection** – Ensures the entire **infrastructure, middleware, and database layers** are recovered, not just individual components.  
**Cross-Region Failover** – Enables businesses to replicate and restore workloads between OCI regions.  
**Automated DR Workflow Generation** – Predefined recovery workflows ensure rapid and reliable disaster response.  
**Prechecks & Validation** – Detects configuration mismatches and prevents recovery failures.  
**Single-Pane-of-Glass Monitoring** – Provides centralized DR control through the **OCI Console and APIs**.  

---

## **2. Understanding OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery Architecture**  
OCI FSDR operates by grouping resources into **Disaster Recovery Protection Groups**, which define all the **compute, storage, networking, and database components** needed for disaster recovery.

### **Key Components:**
- **Primary Region** – The production environment where applications are actively running.
- **Standby Region** – The secondary region where disaster recovery workloads are replicated and ready for failover.
- **DR Protection Group (DRPG)** – A collection of resources (Compute, Storage, Database, Middleware) that are treated as a single unit for disaster recovery.
- **DR Plan** – A sequence of steps (failover, failback, validation) to transition services from **Primary to Standby**.
- **Prechecks** – Automated validation checks that verify the readiness of DR workflows.
- **DR Plan Execution** – The process of activating the DR plan during an actual disaster or a drill.

## **3. Recovery Strategies: Switchover vs. Failover**  
OCI FSDR provides two recovery options:

### **Switchover (Planned Transition)**
- Used for **maintenance or testing**.
- Gracefully shuts down applications in the **Primary Region** before starting them in the **Standby Region**.
- Ensures **zero data loss** and minimal downtime.

### **Failover (Unplanned Transition)**
- Triggered during **unexpected failures** (natural disasters, cyberattacks, hardware failures).
- Brings up applications in the **Standby Region** without shutting down the Primary.
- Focuses on **minimizing downtime**, even if some transactions are lost.

## **4. Deployment Models: Warm Standby vs. Cold Standby**
OCI FSDR supports **two standby deployment models**, depending on recovery time objectives (RTO) and cost considerations.

| Deployment Model | Description | Cost | Recovery Time |
|-----------------|-------------|------|--------------|
| **Warm Standby** | Some or all components pre-deployed in the Standby Region | Higher | Lower RTO |
| **Cold Standby** | Minimal pre-deployment; resources are provisioned on demand | Lower | Higher RTO |

**Example Use Case:**  
A **banking application** that requires **low downtime (RTO < 15 minutes)** will use **Warm Standby**, whereas a **development environment** with **less critical workloads** can opt for **Cold Standby** to save costs.

## **5. Step-by-Step Setup of OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery**
### **Step 1: Define Disaster Recovery Scope**
- Identify **business-critical applications** that need DR protection.
- Define **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**.

### **Step 2: Configure DR Protection Groups**
- Navigate to the **OCI Console → Full Stack DR Service**.
- Create a **Disaster Recovery Protection Group (DRPG)**.
- Select **resources (Compute, Storage, Networking, Databases, Load Balancers, Middleware)** to be protected.

### **Step 3: Associate Primary and Standby Regions**
- Pair the **Primary and Standby DR Protection Groups**.
- Enable **data replication** between regions.

### **Step 4: Generate and Customize DR Plans**
- OCI automatically generates a **Disaster Recovery Plan** based on selected resources.
- Customize **recovery workflows** (Add pre-checks, delay steps, dependency mappings).

### **Step 5: Validate the DR Plan with Prechecks**
- Run **automated prechecks** to ensure the DR plan aligns with the latest production setup.
- Fix **configuration mismatches** before initiating a DR drill.

### **Step 6: Conduct a DR Drill (Optional)**
- Execute a **test failover** to validate the DR process without disrupting production.
- Review logs and performance metrics.

### **Step 7: Execute Failover or Switchover**
- During an actual disaster, trigger the **failover process**.
- Once the **Primary Region is restored**, initiate a **failback** to return workloads to the original region.
